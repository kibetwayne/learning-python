'''
are used to execute a block of code multiple times. Useful when working with repetitive tasks or performing operations over a range of values.
1.	for loop: iterates over a sequence or a range of numbers.
2.	while loop: Repeats a block of code if a specified condition is True.

#? (syntax: for item in sequence)  for <variable> in <collection>: <code to repeat>

#for loop in range == often used to loop a specific number of times
#? (syntax: for item in range(staring value, end, step value)
for i in range(1,6):#prints starting with 1 upto 5

'''
Break == exits loops immediately if condition is met.

#?Iterating over a list and modifying it
'''!Never modify something while you iterate over it. Keep mutation and looping separate. 
Do this instead:
        1. Build up a new list from scratch.  
        2. Modify a copy.
        3. Iterate over a copy and modify the original.

# * numbers = [10, 7, 8, 3, 12, 15]
# * for number in numbers:
# *     if number <= 10:
# *         numbers.remove(number)
# * print(numbers)

''' As it runs, it clearly skips even looking at 7 or 3 and doesn't remove them. The index variable i runs through the usual values 0, 1, 2, ... as it's supposed to, but as the list changes those are no longer the positions we want. For example in the first iteration i is 0 and number is 10, which gets removed. This shifts the rest of the numbers left one position, so now 7 is in position 0. But then in the next iteration i is 1, and numbers[i] is 8. 7 got skipped.'''

# Use a copy of the original collection if you need to modify it.

big_numbers = numbers.copy()

for number in numbers:
    if number <= 10:
