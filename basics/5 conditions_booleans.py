They combine multiple conditions into a single expression.

#ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰OBJECT IDENTITY 'IS'
'''
Object identity refers to the uniqueness of an object. It can be thought of as its "address" in memory, which remains constant for the lifetime of the object. You can use Python's built-in id() function to get the identity of an object.
â€¢	Identity (IS) checks if two variables reference the exact same object in memory.
â€¢	Equality (==) checks if two objects have the same value (i.e., content).
'''
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a  
print(id(a))
print(id(b))      # Both a and b now point to the same object(have same id)

print(a is b)     # True, both refer to the same list
print(a == b)     # True, same content

# Create a new, separate list with the same content
c = [1, 2, 3]
print(a is c)     #  False,  a and c are different objects
print(a == c)     #  True,  same content

'''
Python optimizes memory usage by reusing objects for some immutable values.
'''
x = 10
y = 10
print(x is y)    # True, because small integers are often reused by Python

x = 1000
y = 1000
print(x is y)    # False, large integers are not necessarily reused

#ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰TRUTHY AND FALSY VALUES
'''
Falsy Values
â€¢	False
â€¢	None
â€¢	0 (zero)
â€¢	"" (empty string)
â€¢	[] (empty list)
â€¢	{} (empty dictionary
'''#everything else returns true
